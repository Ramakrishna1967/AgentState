"""Thread-safe ring buffer for in-memory span batching.

The buffer holds spans in memory until the BatchSpanProcessor flushes them.
When the buffer is full (capacity reached), the oldest spans are silently
dropped — this prevents unbounded memory growth under high load.

Thread safety is provided via a threading.Lock wrapping all mutations.
